# Slack Tab Close
When Slack links are clicked, a tab is opened in your browser which then redirects to Slack Desktop.  
This addon closes those tabs after two seconds (which is pretty arbitrary, it could be a lot shorter).

The code almost certainly isn't optimal, it was a quick hack after work today.
